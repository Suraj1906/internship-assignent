# Vite React Internship Project

This is a React + Vite project built for an internship assignment.
Features:
- Home landing hero with animated gradient and big CTA buttons
- To-Do app with Redux Toolkit and localStorage persistence
- GitHub user search dashboard (uses GitHub Users API)
- Animations for route transitions, task cards, and GitHub card
- Dark/Light mode toggle (persists to localStorage)
- Modern styling, gradients, and glassmorphism

## Setup

1. Extract the ZIP.
2. Open a terminal inside the project folder.
3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Run dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open the URL printed by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173).

## Notes

- The To-Do app uses Redux Toolkit. Default tasks are preloaded and stored in localStorage.
- GitHub API requests are unauthenticated and subject to GitHub rate limits. For heavy testing, consider adding a personal access token.
- If you see an error about missing dependencies, run `npm install` again.

Good luck with your internship submission â€” make sure to include a short README and a few screenshots in your GitHub repo!
